# .gitignore

`.gitignore` is one of the most relevant files working with the Git. There is often the time when you are working with:

* Secrets/API keys/Creds
* operating system files, ex. .DS_Store on Mac
* log files
* Dependencies/packages/venvs

This files should be included in the root repo. Inside the patterns there will be files that should be omitted like:

```bash
.DS_Store
*.log
folder_A/
/.idea
```
